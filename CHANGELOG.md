### Added

- Add `team` attribute to `Message` and `Command` models. This stores the ID of the Slack Team that the call originated from.

### Changed

- Allow configuration to be partially updated ([@RealOrangeOne](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne) in [#81](https://github.com/sedders123/phial/pull/81))

- Help command now allows commands to have no docstring, or override help text, specified.

### Changed
