## [0.11.1](https://github.com/sedders123/phial/releases/tag/0.11.1) - 2025-02-07

### Fixed

- Commands that are wrapped with a functools.wrap decorator no longer fail parameter validation

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/sedders123/phial/releases/tag/0.11.0) - 2025-02-07

### Changed

- Upgrade to use slack_sdk and Socket Mode. This is a breaking change and will require you to update your code to use the new API.

### Removed

- Removed hot reload functionality. This may be re-added in a future release.

## [0.10.1](https://github.com/sedders123/phial/releases/tag/0.10.1) - 2019-10-04

### Fixed

- Fixed default arguments in commands not being overridable.

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/sedders123/phial/releases/tag/0.10.0) - 2019-09-13

### Added

- Concurrent commands and jobs. Command and jobs now run concurrently by default. You can modify the maximum number of concurrent events using the `maxThreads` property on the config object, by default its value is 4. To opt out of this feature you can set the value of the config key to `1` and the old syncrhonous behaviour will remain.
- Hot reload functionality. If phial detects a file has changed it will reload the file and restart the bot. Enable this using the `hotReload` key in the phial config (Valid values `True` and `False`. Defaults to `False`)
- Type hint validation. If you use inline type hints to specify the type of a command's parameter phial will now validate the users input and convert it to the specified type. for use in your command function.

### Changed

- Scheduled jobs now will reschedule if the job's function errors.

### Removed

- Python 3.5 support

## [0.9.1](https://github.com/sedders123/phial/releases/tag/0.9.1) - 2019-06-19

### Fixed

- Error when phial logged an error

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/sedders123/phial/releases/tag/0.9.0) - 2019-05-31

### Added

- Added 'loopDelay' config option. Specifes how to long to sleep for in the main loop, this helps to prevent super high CPU usage while phial is doing nothing. Defaults to 0.001
- Added `hide_from_help_command` argument to command creation. This hides the command from the list generated by inbuilt help command.

### Changed

- Python 3.6.1 is now marked as incompatible due to an issue with the `NoReturn` type

### Deprecated

- Deprecated Python 3.5 Support. This is intended to be the last phial release to support Python 3.5

phial has undergone a major internal rewrite and while the public API has largely stayed the same this version should not be seen as a drop in replacement.

### Changed

- Set minimum Python version to 3.5 (this has been the case since 0.3.0).
- The global `command` variable is now of type `Message`.

### Removed

### Changed

- Allow consumers of the pacakge to use phial's type hints

### Added

- Add `team` attribute to `Message` and `Command` models. This stores the ID of the Slack Team that the call originated from.

### Changed

- Allow configuration to be partially updated ([@RealOrangeOne](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne) in [#81](https://github.com/sedders123/phial/pull/81))

### Changed

- SlackClient now attempts to auto reconnect by default. This can be turned off in the settings
- Logs outputted using the default logger no longer duplicate
- SlackClient no longer asks for team state as phial does not use this. Should speed up connection times espically in larger teams

### Changed

- Help command now works better with multiline doc strings. The command now ignores single new lines and converts double new lines into single new lines, similar to markdown
